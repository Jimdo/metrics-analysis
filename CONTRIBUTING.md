:balloon: Thanks for your help improving the project!

## Developer Certificate of Origin ##

To contribute to this project, you must agree to the Developer Certificate of
Origin (DCO) for each commit you make. The DCO is a simple statement that you,
as a contributor, have the legal right to make the contribution.

See the [DCO](DCO) file for the full text of what you must agree to.

### Option 1: commit message signoffs ###

One way to signify that you agree to the DCO for a commit is to add a line to
the git commit message:

```txt
Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>
```

In most cases, you can add this signoff to your commit automatically with the
`-s` flag to `git commit`. You must use your real name and a reachable email
address (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

### Option 2: public statement ###

If you've already made the commits and don't want to engage in git shenanigans
to retroactively apply the signoff as above, there is another option: leave a
comment on the PR with the following statement: "I agree to the DCO for all the
commits in this PR."

Note that this option also requires that your commits are made under your real
name and a reachable email address.

### Option 3: very simple changes ###

Changes that are trivial (e.g. spelling corrections, adding to ADOPTERS.md,
one-word changes) do not require a DCO signoff. Maintainers should feel free to
override the DCO bot for these changes.

## Submitting a Pull Request ##

1. Fork this repo, develop and test your code changes. See the project's
   [README](README.md) for further information about working in this repository.
2. Submit a pull request against this repo's `main` branch.
    - Include instructions on how to test your changes.
    - If you are making a change to the user interface (UI), include a
      screenshot of the UI before and after your changes.
3. Your branch may be merged once changes are reviewed and issues are addressed.

### Commit messages ###

Finalized commit messages should be in the following format:
